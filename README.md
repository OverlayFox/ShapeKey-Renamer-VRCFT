# ShapeKey Renamer for FaceTracking
This is a simple script that renames your shapekeys inside of blender according to a dictionary.

## Introduction
It automatically converts your avatars shapekeys into a standard naming scheme used for facial tracking.<br>
So that you can use pre-made templates for you avatar more easily.<br>
<br>
It was born out of a desire to use the [VRCFaceTracking-Templates](https://github.com/Adjerry91/VRCFaceTracking-Templates) from [Adjerry91](https://github.com/Adjerry91) with the [MagPieV6 Avatar](https://www.patreon.com/posts/rex-mod-magpie-6-79363823) from [KuraiKitsune](https://www.patreon.com/KuraiKitsune).<br>
But sadly the shapekeys didn't have the right naming scheme to automatically work with any of the standard face tracking blend shapes like SRanipal, ARkit or UnifiedExpressions.<br>
<br>
So I made this script to automatically rename the MagPie into the naming scheme used by UnifiedExpressions.<br>

## Currently supported Conversions:
- MagPie V6 to UnifiedExpressions

## Roadmap:
- Rexouium to UnifiedExpressions
- SRanipal to UnifiedExpressions
- SRanipal to Arkit
- ARkit to UnifiedExpressions
- ARkit to SRanipal
- UnifiedExpressions to SRanipal
- UnifiedExpressions to ARkit
